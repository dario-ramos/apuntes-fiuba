# Contribution guidelines

Issues and pull requests are welcome. I will do my best to reply as promptly as possible.

## Issues

If you find an issue in the content, say for example a wrongly stated theorem, please aim to be as thorough as possible when indicating where it is,
why it is wrong, and if possible, the suggested correction. Even better, if you can provide an authoritative bibliographical reference, I will be
very thankful. Learning is always the priority.

## Pull requests

Please make sure that the CI build still works before submitting a contribution that modifies LaTeX code. If it is a non-trivial content-related fix
or addition, I suggest discussing the change in an issue before creating a PR.
